* About
This project functions as a template for new Python projects to be set up using [[https://nixos.org][Nix]]. By using Nix for your next Python project you will get:
1. Reproducable builds and development environments
2. No need for a venv to isolate the project's python environment
3. No need for pyenv or similar to manage your Python version: Nix allows for a *complete* project declaration that doesn't bloat your system
4. Use Poetry to manage your dependencies, but build them from generated nix derivations created by poetry2nix
* Requirements
You will need [[https://nixos.org][Nix]] installed with [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes][flakes enabled]]. Additionally I recommend [[https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv][nix-direnv]] (with flake support) to have direnv set you up automatically with the latest version of your flake. If not a fan of direnv: just execute ``nix develop`` in the project root to enter your project's environment
* Usage
#+begin_src shell
  $ git clone https://github.com/sebastiant/nix-python-template.git
  $ cd nix-python-template
  $ cp .env_vars.template .env_vars # A sample environment variable that direnv will export
  $ direnv allow # A first time thing to accept the contents of .envrc
  $ echo $SECRET # Environment variables from .env_vars conveniently accessible from shell as well as from your Python project
  $ myapp # your app is built and accessible
  $ ipython # so are development dependencies
  $ emacs & # Code away! Or even smoother: add direnv-support for your favourite editor so you can start it from anywhere
#+end_src
